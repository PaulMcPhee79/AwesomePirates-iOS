List of all "committed" changes:

2011/07/28
- Changed all atlases to Gzipped PVR.
- Changed venue/shop entrance delays to match shorter loading time of PVR textures.
- Removed tavern-ambience from Tavern scene's SceneReqs. It is now played by the TavernVenue.
- Made sure tweens were removed from a sound channel before its volume was eased to a new level, even if the ease duration is zero.
- Backing up working copy before changing scene swap animation. The PVR textures don't create good SPRenderTextures, so we will change this process in next version.

2011/07/27
- Changed Splash scene/view to work with new logo that slides into place.
- Added ambient sfx to splash scene.
- Changed splash scene to use twinkle-splash.png so that a Preloaded Cove scene didn't clash with it and hold it in memory (through the texture manager).
- Added Felix's Parcel-2 sounds.
- CoveVenues can play their music and ambience at individual volumes.
