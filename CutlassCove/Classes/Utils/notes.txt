	TODO: 
 
	1. NSZombieEnabled to find stray pointers etc. See www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?NSZombieEnabled.
	2. Pre-iOS4 devices do not have multi-tasking and so we may need to save game state on app losing focus. Test this.
	4. Need to test on devices running every non-point version of iOS: (3.0, 3.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2).
	5. Read Apple Forum Stickies (Game Center etc).
	6. Change NSLog's to DLog and ALog and asserts to ZAssert. See .pch file for details.
	7. Do I need to worry about Reachability (i.e. not missing Network Alerts)? See iOS Reference Library sample Reachability App.
	8. Test app under low-memory conditions using the Simulate Memory Warning command in the simulator.
	9. pngcrush all atlases to reduce binary size (lossless compression).
	10. Done
	11. Save progress and scores on separate thread. Any saves requested when one is already in progress are added to a save queue and performed when the current
		save callback reaches the main thread. This way we can use AES to encode hi scores and progress. Also, save in binary form (non human-readable) if possible.
	12. Ensure only one view controller active at any one time to abide by Apple Guidelines.
	13. Game Center will indicate that a score was successfully reported even though it wasn't if the connection is lost after the local player is authenticated. Do
		we need to check for 3g or wifi connectivity as part of our Game Center isAuthenticated check?
	14. See Cocoa with Love - Assign, retain,  copy: pitfalls (in comments) to ensure custom properties are valid.
	15. Update player's ships/cannons if they have fewer than their Game Center achievements suggest (quasi online save method when switching devices).
	15. Sparrow Edits:
		- SPJuggler.m: mObjects = nil; in dealloc to prevent stray pointer call.
		- 
	16. Try Cochin-BoldItalic in place of MarkerFelt, provided it is available pre-ios4. It looks quite piratey in its lowercase form.
	17. BUG: You can currently cheese same achievements like prohibition or sedition because GameCoder is not saving the state of having bought grog etc. So when
		you load your game, you get all these achievements even though you haven't actually achieved them.
	18. Get rid of "Close but no Cigar" achievement or fix for PrimeShips and Escorts.
	19. Done
	20. Done
	21. Rename "Death from the Deep" to "Davy's Grip".
	22. Somehow reference "St. Elmo's Fire". See: www.blindkat.hegewisch.net/pirates/Nautical_Myths.html
	23. Done
	24. Use this: SPTouch *touch =  [[event.touchesWithTarget:sprite] anyObject]; if (touch.phase == SPTouchPhaseBegan) else if (touch.phase == SPTouchPhaseMoved) ...
	25. Wrap GameCoder.loadGameState in an exception handler so we cannot get into a situation where the application never loads properly upon a failed load (BAD!!!).
	26. Add method to GameController to purge unused pLists from Globals in case of low memory warning.
	27. Replace dispatch_async etc (Grand Central Dispatch) with [NSThread detachNewThreadSelector...].
	28. Make tutorial start with entering the Cove explanation so that people don't skip it if they get tired of waiting for the tutorial to finish.
	29. Make sure there are no endless loops looking for free spawn positions in ActorAi. Do tests that deliberately tie up positions and then force large spawns.
	30. Play with mutiny and condition off so that I can reach a much higher level and can test conditions that would otherwise be impossible to test.
	31. Encode all plists with AES encryption to deter casual cheaters.
	32. Ensure SP_IS_FLOAT_EQUAL in SPDisplayObjectContainer's render method when checking for child alpha.
	
	UPDATES:
	
	1. Scenarios: Spanish Armada.
	2. Multi-player: Town vs Ship. Town has wow-like action bar with ability to send out Navy Ships, Special Moves (Elite Armada) and fires town cannons.
	3. Multi-player: Co-op on two different screens. Left screen tries to limit the number of Navy Ships and Pirate Ships (problems) from getting to the
	   right screen. Right screen plays game as usual and they both share score.
	4. Rogue Bar in Swindlers Alley. Can purchase/hire specialist crew members (i.e. Voodoo priestess, Master Cannoneer) who boost stats/effectiveness or
	   offer other bonuses.
	5. Treasure Island: Archipelago with X marks the spot treasure appearing randomly on islands. You must beat other Pirates to the treasure or sink them
	   and reclaim it.
	6. New Voodoo Spells: Giant Squid, Arctic Freeze, Tidal Wave, Acid Swell, Summon Neptune, Sea of Grog (boats turn in circles), Enveloping Slumber (line of black mist. Any
	   that go through it have crew go to sleep. Lasts for a long time but only covers small area), Wandering Plague (infected ships seek out others to spread disease to, so
	   it sort of becomes an ally before its crew dies), Moby Dick (whale swims around turning boats over).
	   Ghostly Embrace: Spirits floating around turning ships into ghost ships that fight for you for a short period before disintegrating, granting you more infamy.
	7. New Gadgets: Flux Capacitor, Toxic Dump (mist that kills any who pass through it), Big Magnet (sticks nearby ships to it).
	8. New Single Player mode: Town on small island in the middle of the map. You control the cannon tower. You rotate the cannon with the "wheel" and aim the
	   cannon trajectory as you normally would. You have to secure the safe transit for the merchant ships.
